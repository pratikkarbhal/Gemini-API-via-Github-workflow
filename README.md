# Gemini Bot

A simple Python bot using **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro** (generative AI) that can help you with your coding problems i.e. Code generation, solution, explanation, etc.

Just update your prompt in `prompt.txt` and let GitHub Actions do the magic.

### Now, you may ask, why??
- So I observed that while being connected to some private networks, There's a filter that blocks use of AI tools. To overcome this, we can use this bot that will run **Gemini** totally on github's headless virtual environment. Avoiding obstacles in your productivity.

### Features
- AI-powered code generation and explanations
- Works with the latest Gemini API
- No need to run anything locally
- Easy to use, just commit and go!

3. **Edit `prompt.txt`** with your question/code
4. **Push the changes** — the bot will run automatically, check results in 'Actions' tab
